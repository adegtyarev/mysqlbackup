2.6:
- do not exit on error while dumping a database;
- support for make -j flag
- optimize ls output parsing
- support for mysqlhotbackup (for replication);
- support for master/slave: optimize/check master, not slave;
- optimize/check only on specified days of week;
- return errors as errors, usage as usage (do not mix opterrors with usage + E_ERRUSAGE)
- add option to allow backup all databases except some ones (exclude-database).
- add configuration file;
- add SHOW MASTER STATUS + LOCK TABLES statements logging before doing dump (allow quick replica restores from backup);
